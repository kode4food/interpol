<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are a lot of templating systems out there and they're all similar.  In truth, Interpol isn't so different, which might beg the question:</p>

<pre><code>Why the hell another templating system?
</code></pre>

<p>The answer is simple.  I'm sick of looking at a template and being unable to read the thing, even if I wrote it yesterday.  That's why I developed Interpol.</p>

<p>That said, Interpol's goals are modest.  It should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide templates where <em>meaning</em> takes a front seat</li>
<li>Work well in both Node.js and the Browser</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, it <em>will not</em> participate in the member-measuring and micro-optimization that seem to be so important to some developers.  Specifically, Interpol has:</p>

<ul>
<li>No desire to have the 'smallest' minified footprint</li>
<li>No desire to be the 'fastest' template processor</li>
</ul>

<p>Interpol will be as <em>small</em> and <em>fast</em> as possible, but no more, especially if those considerations would require compromising the aforementioned goal of providing <em>meaning</em>.</p>

<h2 id="interpol-seeks-meaning">Interpol Seeks 'Meaning'</h2>

<p>Stuff you write should 'mean' something.  Not only at the time it's written, but years later.  It should also mean something to new eyes.  The arguments for terseness haven't flown since we stopped using punch cards.  So, assuming you know some HTML, take a look at this Interpol template to understand what I suggest by <em>meaning</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  for person in people when person.active
    &lt;div class="person"&gt;
      &lt;div class="name"&gt; person.name &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="address"&gt; person.address &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="telephone"&gt; person.telephone &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  else
    &lt;div class="empty"&gt;
      "Nobody to render!"
    &lt;/div&gt;
  end
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In looking at this, you can probably understand why "Nobody to render!" must be quoted.  It's because Interpol focuses on producing the structure and content of dynamic HTML documents.  It's a "path of least resistance" approach that forgoes static content 'escaping' methods such as <code>{</code> braces <code>}</code>.  Static content is becoming less frequent in a world of localized web apps, so Interpol chooses to shift the resistance in that direction.</p>

<p>This template is actually completely dynamic, including the HTML tags and attributes. It just so happens that these tags consist of literals, but you could also generate tags based on variables.  For example:</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;div class="person"&gt;
  for field in ('name', 'address', 'telephone')
    &lt;div class=field&gt; person[field] &lt;/div&gt;
  end
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>class</code> attribute of the second div, rather than being a literal string, is retrieved from the field names that are processed.</p>

<h2 id="dont-repeat-yourself">Don't Repeat Yourself</h2>

<p>What if you find that you need the ability to re-use the rendering of people?  Both groups and individuals?  You can break them out into partials:</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    renderPeople(people)
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

def renderPeople(people)
  for person in people when person.active
    renderPerson(person)
  else
    &lt;div class="empty"&gt;
      "Nobody to render!"
    &lt;/div&gt;
  end
end

def renderPerson(person)
  &lt;div class="person"&gt;
    for field in ('name', 'address', 'telephone')
      &lt;div class=field&gt; person[field] &lt;/div&gt;
    end
  &lt;/div&gt;
end
</code></pre>

<p>What if you need to do a special rendering for people who don't want their demographic data presented?  You can add a guarded version of the partial:</p>

<pre><code class="html">def renderPerson(person) when person.likesPrivacy
  &lt;div class="person"&gt;
    &lt;div class="name"&gt; person.name &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
end
</code></pre>

<h2 id="no-really-dont-repeat-yourself">No, Really, Don't Repeat Yourself</h2>

<p>What if you use these partials in multiple templates?  Then you can move them out into their own module, maybe called <code>people.int</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="html"># this is people.int
def renderPeople(people)
  for person in people when person.active
    renderPerson(person)
  else
    &lt;div class="empty"&gt;
      "Nobody to render!"
    &lt;/div&gt;
  end
end

def renderPerson(person)
  &lt;div class="person"&gt;
    for field in ('name', 'address', 'telephone')
      &lt;div class=field&gt; person[field] &lt;/div&gt;
    end
  &lt;/div&gt;
end

def renderPerson(person) when person.likesPrivacy
  &lt;div class="person"&gt;
    &lt;div class="name"&gt; person.name &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
end
</code></pre>

<p>And import them like so:</p>

<pre><code class="html">from people import renderPeople
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    renderPeople(people)
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Easy as pie!  And your primary template gets right to the point.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>

<p>The grammar has stabilized.  The run-time library is still under development, particularly formatting generators.  Optimizations still need to be made.  Check <a href="doc/TODO.md">the TODO document</a> for an idea of what's to come.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>A pre-built version of the parser is already included.  If you'd like to build it yourself then you can do so by issuing the following command from the package's top-level directory:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">npm install &amp;&amp; npm run-script build &amp;&amp; npm test
</code></pre>

<p>This will also install any development dependencies and run the nodeunit test suite.</p>

<h2 id="inclusion-in-nodejs">Inclusion in Node.js</h2>

<p>Assuming you have installed the Interpol package with npm, you can include it in your Node code with the following:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var interpol = require('interpol');
</code></pre>

<h2 id="inclusion-in-a-browser">Inclusion in a Browser</h2>

<p>There are two ways to include Interpol templates in a browser-based application.  One is to compile raw templates using the Interpol compiler.  Another is to load the templates from pre-compiled JSON output.  The PEG.js parser used by the compiler is <em>massive</em> and slower than loading JSON, but it may be necessary if you want to compile ad-hoc templates.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> The entry point function for Interpol in the browser is <em>always</em> named <code>$interpol()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="loading-pre-compiled-json">Loading Pre-Compiled JSON</h3>

<p>The <code>$interpol()</code> function will accept a pre-compiled JSON object instead of a JavaScript string.  This will allow you to bypass the loading of the PEG.js parser.  Instead, you can load pre-compiled templates from your server for faster initialization.</p>

<p>You can also invoke the compiler by calling the <code>$interpol.compile(Object)</code> function.</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="build/interpol.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note:</em> The Interpol command-line interface generates pre-compiled JSON.  You can install this globally using <code>npm -g install</code> and can then invoke the tools at your terminal by typing <code>interpol</code>.</p>

<h3 id="including-the-pegjs-compiler">Including the PEG.js Compiler</h3>

<p>If you <em>must</em> parse raw templates in the browser, you will need to load the version of Interpol that includes the compiler (and its PEG.js parser).</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="build/interpol-parser.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="using-the-library">Using the Library</h2>

<p>To compile a raw template into a closure, invoke <code>$interpol(String)</code> as a function.  Provide to it a string containing your template:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var compiledTemplate = $interpol(someTemplateString);
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate a closure that takes up to two parameters, both of which are optional.  The first is the data that your template renders.  The second is an options object used to override the content writer interface.  By default, the library writes to a JavaScript string.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">console.log(
  compiledTemplate({
    list: [
      { type: 'task', id: 1, name: 'This is my first task' },
      { type: 'story', id: 2, name: 'This is my first story' }
    ]
  })
);
</code></pre>
